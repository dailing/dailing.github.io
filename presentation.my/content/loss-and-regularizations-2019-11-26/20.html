    <p>
        Any modiﬁcation we make to a learning algorithm that is intended to 
        <red>reduce its generalization error</red>
        but
        <red>not its training error</red>.
    </p>

    <p>
        An eﬀective regularizer is one that makes a proﬁtable trade, 
        <red>reducing variance signiﬁcantly</red> while
        <red>not overly increasing the bias</red>.
