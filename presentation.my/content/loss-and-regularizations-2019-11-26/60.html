<div class="col col-12">
    <ul>
        <li> the amount of data we have is limited</li>
        <li>it is reasonably straightforward to create newfake data</li>
        <li>images variation can be easily simulated</li>
        <li>be careful not to apply transformations that would change the correct class</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This approach is not as readily applicable to many other tasks!</p>
